# Data Analyst Internship - Task 1: Excel Basics – Data Cleaning & Formatting

## Overview
This repository contains the completed Task 1. The task involved cleaning and formatting a messy dataset using Excel to prepare it for analysis.

## Tools Used
- Primary: Microsoft Excel

## Dataset
- `Raw_Data.xlsx` — Original messy dataset with missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.
- `Cleaned_dataset.xlsx` — Cleaned version of the dataset in Excel.
- `cleaned_dataset.csv` — Cleaned dataset exported to CSV for easy use in analysis or code.

## Cleaning Steps Performed
1. Checked and froze headers for easier navigation.
2. Identified missing values and handled them appropriately (replaced, left blank, or noted in `Data_Quality_Notes` column).
3. Detected and removed duplicates carefully.
4. Standardized text fields using `TRIM`, `PROPER`, `UPPER` functions.
5. Validated and corrected date, numeric, and categorical columns.
6. Created a separate “Cleaned_Data” sheet to maintain raw vs cleaned separation.
7. Added a `Data_Quality_Notes` column to document any issues or observations.
8. Exported the final cleaned dataset to CSV format for further analysis.

## Outcome
The task demonstrates the ability to:
- Clean and standardize real-world messy data.
- Maintain proper data hygiene by keeping raw and cleaned data separate.
- Produce a dataset ready for analysis.

##  Screenshots
Screenshots showing before and after cleaning are located in the `screenshots/` folder.

## Notes
- Raw data should always be preserved to prevent irreversible mistakes.
- Cleaning steps can be reused for similar datasets in the future.
